# Melissa IP Address Tracker

A clean and responsive IP address tracking application that allows users to look up IP address information and visualize the location on an interactive map.

The project uses the IPify Geolocation API to fetch IP details and Leaflet.js to display location data on an OpenStreetMap-powered map.
